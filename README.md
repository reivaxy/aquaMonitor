# aquaMonitor
Monitoring a recifal aquarium with arduino, and sending alerts by SMS

For now, more POC than anything.

Monitors light and temperature and sends an SMS to a pre defined mobile phone number when below configurable thresholds.

Thresholds can be configured through an IR remote control

When complete, will probably not fit on Arduino UNO.

Feel free to use and modify and let me know.
