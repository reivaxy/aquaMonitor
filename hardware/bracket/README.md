The aquaMonitor.scad file contains three modules, each needs to be rendered separately and printed:

The main body, the insert, and the light shield. The light shield should then be glued on top of the main body in the best position depending on the relative position of your lightening devices and the light sensor.

You can check the aquaMonitorDemo.stl file to see a 3D rendering of the bracket with its insert and light shield positionned (but the whole thing is upside down)
