The aquaMonitor.scad file contains two modules, each needs to be rendered separately and printed:

The main body, and the insert.

New version: the light sensor is enclosed in the bracket, to avoid salt and corrosion (four sensors died because of it already). This means the bracket needs to be printed with transparent ABS or PET. 

You can check the <a href="https://github.com/reivaxy/aquaMonitor/blob/master/hardware/bracket/aquaMonitorDemo.stl">aquaMonitorDemo.stl file to see a 3D rendering of the bracket</a> with its insert positionned.
