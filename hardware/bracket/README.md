The aquaMonitor.scad file contains three modules, each needs to be rendered separately and printed:

The main body, the insert, and the tiny light shield. The light shield should then be glued on top of the main body in the best position depending on the relative position of your lightening devices and the light sensor.

New version: the light sensor is enclosed in the bracket, to avoid corrosion (two sensors died because of it already). This means the bracket needs to be printed with transparent ABS or PET. Tiny light shield is then no longer necessary.

You can check the <a href="https://github.com/reivaxy/aquaMonitor/blob/master/hardware/bracket/aquaMonitorDemo.stl">aquaMonitorDemo.stl file to see a 3D rendering of the bracket</a> with its insert and light shield positionned.
